    <p>Groove Catcher is an award-winning, energetic VR game that takes the rhythm game genre to the next level by including the musicâ€™s melody and groove into its core gameplay. By going beyond the typical 'mash & smash on the beat' model, it gets players moving musically, using motion dynamics to lead players into expressive movements.</p>
    <p>While having fun, players learn to follow a musical piece in different ways, using their ears, eyes and body. Each level is hand-crafted by a dancer, and thus closely reflects the dancer's interpretation of the melody and groove of the music.  </p>
    <p>Groove Catcher is in a stable, playable, demo-able alpha state.</p>
    <p>Groove Catcher is a companion project to Sculptor, a prototype VR tool for creating dynamic music sculptures (and for creating Groove Catcher levels!).</p>
